# V2SV

V2SV is a basic Verilog to SystemVerilog converter. While all Verilog code is valid SystemVerilog code as well, this tool aims to modify Verilog code to take advantage of new SystemVerilog constructs.

## Features

This tool will take advantage of these SystemVerilog constructs, which offer improvements over their Verilog counterparts:
* The `logic` datatype (as opposed to `wire` and `reg`)
* `always_comb` and `always_ff` blocks (as opposed to `always`, which may cause unintended behavior if used incorrectly)
* Enumerations (as opposed to `localparam`)

## Usage

To be filled in.
